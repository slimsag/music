A dizi is a Chinese transverse flute, usually made out of Bamboo (but some more modern ones are also made of plastic, metal, and Afgan jade).

It is unique compared to modern western concert flutes in the fact that it has a very thin paper membrane covering a hole near the mouthpiece which causes it to produce a buzzing noise somewhat like a recorder mixed with a kazoo. The membrane can be tightened to lesson the kazoo sound, or loosened to increase it.

The word "dizi" itself is an English transliteration for the Chinese word for "flute" (笛子). It is also known as "di" (笛) which also means "flute", or "heng-di" (横笛) meaning "transverse flute" or "horizontal flute". Lastly, "zhu-di" (竹笛) meaning "bamboo flute". All of these word variants are conglomerated, with "dizi" being the most common form.

## Types of dizis

There are two primary category of dizi (all of which are transverse / horizontally held):

- A "qu-di" (曲笛) or "song flute". They are regular sized and larger sized flutes, producing a wide range of sounds between very deep noises from bass G dizis and very high pitch noises from G dizis.
- A "bang-dí" (梆笛) or "bang flute". They are small (around 30cm) and very high-pitched. "bāng" (梆) is a type of traditional Chinese opera music where this flute originated and is often used (as e.g. "the lead opera singer").

## Musical notation

Nearly all dizi music you find will not be in any form of western notation. Instead, it will be in Chinese [simple notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_musical_notation#Examples).

If you intend to play traditional Chinese music, you will be well off if you learn Chinese simple notation. However, if you intend to play modern, anime, or k-pop music on the flute this will not benefit you much.

This website uses a form of flute fingerings (or "tabatures") to denote musical notation. In practice, I've found this to be the most optimal way to describe dizi music for the following reasons:

1. As a beginner, you don't need to memorize the notes of your dizi (which change based on which key your dizi is) AND learn sheet music at the same time.
2. Dizis produce notes that merely shift in frequency based on the flute. If a song on this website is for a C dizi, you can play it just the same on any other dizi key and it will usually sound fine. This means you don't need to transpose the music or purchase the entire key range of dizis while learning.
3. The fingering form is more clear to read at a distance than Chinese simple notation which relies on subtle accent dots above and below the numbers to denote specific notes.
4. The fingering is more expressive than simple notation as it can express the extended out-of-key notes a dizi can reach.

Here is a comparison chart:

Just like regular western note notation and sheet music notation, simple notation does not have any clear mapping directly to a dizi. This is because it is general purpose and applies to all instruments instead of just the dizi.

However, the fingering / tabature approach above has a direct relationship: ○ denotes a hole on the flute uncovered, and ● covered. More importantly, the middle <x-m1></x-m1>, <x-m2></x-m2>, and <x-m3></x-m3> dots directly tell you the blowing level needed to achieve the note. The only thing it cannot convey is note timing/duration, as to be expected given it is a simple "tabature" form.
