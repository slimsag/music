# slimsag's music resources

Here you'll find music and general information about Chinese instruments, mostly the Dizi flute.

If you don't know how to read Chinese like me, these are probably the best resources you'll find.

I'm always happy to chat about Chinese instruments, so if you want to just shoot me a message ({{.MyEmail}})!

If you are here for my work as a software developer, this website isn't for you. See my [GitHub](https://github.com/slimsag) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-gutekanst-11395a110/) profiles instead.

## Dizi (Chinese Bamboo Flute)

This is a bit like other Bamboo flutes except it has a very thin paper membrane covering one hole, which causes it to produce a buzzing noise (sounds somewhere inbetween a recorder and a kazoo, depending on how taunt you glue the membrane on).

Basically a Chinese version of the Violin, except it only has one string and is pushed a bit like a guitar to produce a quite broad range of noise quite like the human voice.

## Guzheng (Chinese zither)

Like a mix between a piano and a guitar =) You pluck it like a guitar, but it has ~21 strings so it has a much larger range than a guitar can perform.

## Pipa (Chinese 'guitar')

Sort of like a guitar, except the top frets are mostly used for creating a 'wavy' noise and the strings are much tougher physically so it produces a higher pitch than a guitar. Not really 'strummed' like a guitar, but rather rapidly plucked with two or five fingers at a time.
